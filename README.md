## Release Notes:
- release 0.0.0 - Proof of work midpoint Nov 15 for class.

## What
A fullstack web application for sharing events within an organization. Users sign up with their organization email, which allows them to post events for other organization members to see. Users can see, upvote and RSVP to events that are posted within their organization.

We created this site as project for our [Northeastern University CS5610 Web Development](https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_fall_2022/) class in fall 2022.

## Objectives
- To become familiar with React and improve our skills with Node, Express, MongoDB, and HTTP requests.
- To create a working fullstack site that we and others could use to share events within our organizations.
