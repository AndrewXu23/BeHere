                <h2>Your organization's event hub</h2>
                <p>
                  Many of us have colleagues or classmates that we like, but
                  aren't friends with. Friendship needs something beyond the
                  regular break room chat or shared desk. That's where{" "}
                  <i>Be Here</i> comes in. The pickup soccer, book clubs, city
                  tours, and other activities you'll find here can be the magic
                  that turns "friendly" into "friendship".
                </p>
                <p>
                  Are you looking for activities in the area or searching for a
                  new hobby, but are hesitant to try out activites with complete
                  strangers. The events you see on <i>Be Here</i> are hosted by
                  members of your organization, so even when you don't know
                  them, you know that you have something in common.
